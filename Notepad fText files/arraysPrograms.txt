Arrays Programs
Others :

1. WAP to sum values of an array.

2. WAP to find the index of an array element.

3. WAP to copy an array by iterating the array.

4. WAP to add two matrices of the same size.

5. WAP to check if an array of integers without 0 and -1.

6. WAP to check if two arrays are equal or not.

   
 
Deletion :

1. WAP to remove a specific element from an array.

2. Write a Java program to remove duplicate elements from an array and
then return the new length of the array.

For ex : Sample array: [20, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50)

After removing the duplicate elements the program should return 4 as the new length of
the array.

Merging :

1. WAP to merge the elements of two arrays in one array.

====================================================

Searching :
1. WAP to test if an array contains a specific value using :
 1.1 Linear/Sequential Search.
 1.2 Binary Search
2. WAP to find the maximum and minimum value in an array.(Todays Topic)

3. WAP to find the second largest and smallest element in an array.

4. WAP to find kth smallest and largest element in an array.

 5. WAP to find the duplicate values of an array of integer values

6. WAP to find the duplicate values of an arrav of string values.

Searching :
7. WAP to find the first duplicate or repeating element in an integer array.

8. There is an array with every element repeated twice except one.
Find that element?

9. WAP to find the number of even and odd integers in a given array
of integers.

10. WAP to find the missing number in integer array of 1 to 10?

11. WAP to find the duplicate elements between two arrays (integer value).

12. WAP to find the duplicate elements between two arravs (String Values).


============================================================

Other program 
"GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.
============
Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.
============
Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.


Example(Input => Output):
35231 => [1,3,2,5,3]
====================
Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
===================
Grade book
Complete the function so that it finds the average of the three scores passed to it and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Numerical Score	Letter Grade
90 <= score <= 100	'A'
80 <= score < 90	'B'
70 <= score < 80	'C'
60 <= score < 70	'D'
0 <= score < 60	'F'
Tested values are all between 0 and 100. Theres is no need to check for negative values or values greater than 100.

=============================

Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

patrick feeney => P.F
==========================
